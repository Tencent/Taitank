- title: PERFORMANCE
  details: Taitank was built to be fast and performance will always be one of Taitank's primary goals. For a layout engine to be able to power any range of applications, it needs to be fast and never stand in the way of a fluid user experience.
- title: CROSS PLATFORM
  details: Taitank is built with cross platform in mind. To ensure Taitank can be used anywhere, it was written in portable C/C++ and has a low number of dependencies and small binary size. This means Taitank can be used on iOS and Android, sharing knowledge, and potentially code, between platforms.
- title: EASY TO LEARN
  details: Taitank is easy to pick up and learn. The interactive documentation pages and a fully fledged layout editor makes it easy to play and learn all the features. If used with any of the major UI frameworks the layout editor even provides code generation.
